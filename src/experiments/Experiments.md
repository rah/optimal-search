# Simulation Experiments
Based on the simulation environment what are the questions to be asked.

## Questions/Experiments
Variables to be considered:
- Patch density 
- Prey density
- Angle of turn
- Turn variability
- Prey replacement

### Random Search in Single Patch (Homogeneous Environment)
- Given random search with a set angle of turn and varience within a single patch/environment what is the number of prey captured. 

 Variables to be modified:
 - Single Patch equal to environment size:
 - Prey density increasing 10, 20 ,40, 80, 160, etc
 - Modify angle of turn between 30, 60, and 90 degrees
 - Modify variance in angle of turn between low and high variablity
 - Prey get replaced on removal so density stays the same

This represents a homogenous environement where prey are distributed randomly. So we are looking at three variables and determining their relationship.

Repeat the above where prey do not get replaced. This represents the drop in capture as the resource gets depeleted.

# Simulation Experiments
Based on the simulation environment what are the questions to be asked.

## Questions/Experiments
Variables to be considered:
- Patch density 
- Prey density
- Angle of turn
- Turn variability
- Prey replacement

### E0: Random Search in Single Patch with Replacement
Given random search with a set angle of turn and varience within a single patch/environment what is the number of prey captured. 
 Variables to be modified:
 - Single Patch equal to environment size:
 - Prey density increasing 10, 20 ,40, 80, 160, etc
 - Modify angle of turn between 30, 60, and 90 degrees
 - Modify variance in angle of turn between low and high variablity
 - Prey get replaced on removal so density stays the same

This represents a homogenous environement where prey are distributed randomly. So we are looking at three variables and determining their relationship.

### E1: Random Search in Single Patch with No Replacement
Repeat the above where prey do not get replaced. This represents the drop in capture as the resource gets depeleted in a patch. So a single patch in a heterogeneous environment

### E3: Random Search in Multiple Patches

Variables:
- Patch Size
- Distance between patches
- Patch density
- Angle of turn
- Varience of turn

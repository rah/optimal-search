Track Analysis - Methods
========================

If absolute values of turns cover a range less than 180 degrees the data
does not have to be considered circular (Batschelet, 1965).

Mean Linear Displacement 
------------------------ 

[1] Linear displacement per step for each individual averaged across
similar trials to calculate mean linear displacement. Compared with
ANOVA using Tukey post hoc comparisions (Sokal and Rohlf, 1981),
performed at selected steps (5, 10, 15, 20). Not performed among steps
due to high degree of autocorrelation. 

[4] Compared beline distances of before and after capture

Mean Step Length
----------------

[1] Determined an average step length for each individual and averaged
values for each experimental trial. Step lengths compared with ANOVA
using Tukey post hoc comparisions (Sokal and Rohlf, 1981)


Throughness
-----------

[1] Sensitive to change in linear displacement and may be affected by
exceptionally long steps. Measured for a large number of steps (20).
Provide a good relative comparason of average search efficiency among
trials. Indices compared with z-test (Sokal and Rohlf, 1981)

Straightness
------------

[1] Indices compared with z-test (Sokal and Rohlf, 1981)

Turning Angle Frequency Distribution
-------------------------------------

[1] Comparisons between empirical distributions used Kolmogorov-Smirnov
two saple test for large unequal samples sizes (Batschelet, 1981; Sokal
and Rohlf, 1981). Comparisons between empirical and theoretical
distributions done using Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodnes of fit test for
intrinsic hypotheses (Sokal and Rohlf, 1981)

Turning Direction
-----------------

[1] Assigned 1 to right and -1 to left and analysed with runs test
(Brown and Downhower 1988)

[3] Number of turns approx equal, showed no obvious patten.

[4] Data for each sample and pooled data arranged in 2 x 2 contingency
tables in couplets of successive turns (nth vs (n+1)th direction) right
right, right left, left right, left left), and G (log likeihood ratio
statistic calculated.

Rate of Change of Direction
---------------------------

[3] Change in direction in degrees per minute. Basal level of 300
increasing to 1300 after feeding. Pooled results of replicates and
plotted mean of first, second ... values of r.c.d. Return to basal level
took about 5 minutes. Hassel & Murdie, 1973 found 30 seconds with
houseflies. Banks, 1957 found coccinellids returned within 1 minute.

Meander Ratio
-------------

[4] Length of search path : beeline distance moved. Comparisons between
trials used Wilcoxon's two-sample test (one-tailed test)

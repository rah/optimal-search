Data and analysis from studies into optimal search of predatory snail _Polinices_.

The study was conducted as part of an unfinished PhD thesis at James Cook University
in 1984 and 1985. Two study sites and two species of Polinices were investigated:

- _Polynices sordidus_ in Townsville
- _Polynices conicus_ in the Sunshine Coast at Marcoola

The data directory contains both original data and derived excel files.

optimal-search
==============

Data and analysis from studies into optimal search of predatory snail _Polinices_.

The study was conducted as part of an unfinished PhD thesis at James Cook University
in 1984 and 1985. Two study sites and two species of Polinices were investigated:

- _Polynices conicus_ in Townsville
- _Polynices incea_ on the Sunshine Coast at Marcoola

The data directory contains:

- ORIG_DATA: 
    - DATAFILE: The original captured data from snails and prey
    - TRACKS: Above files separated into individual tracks
- ATTACK: Attack behaviour of _P. sordidus_
- ANALYSIS: Conversion of tracks into excel spreadsheets with some initial graphs and analysis

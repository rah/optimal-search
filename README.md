# Optimal Search Behaviour

Data and analysis from studies into optimal search of predatory snail _Polinices_.

![_Polynices sp_](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70077?v=4)

Polynices snails search for prey in the intertidal zone at low tide. The environment within
which they search represents a 2-dimensional plane. Prey items appear to be detected via mechanical response
rather than chemical senses (although this is likely to play a part). 

This analysis asks two questions concerning the optimal search path:
 - to find a prey item given an environmental abundance of that item
 - to find a prey item once discovered and the prey item evades the predator
 - when to give up searching in a particular area
 - when to give up searching for a detected item 

The study was conducted as part of an unfinished PhD thesis at James Cook University
in 1984 and 1985. Two study sites and two species of Polinices were investigated:

- _Polynices conicus_ in Townsville
- _Polynices incea_ on the Sunshine Coast at Marcoola

The data directory contains:

- ORIG_DATA: 
    - DATAFILE: The original captured data from snails and prey
    - TRACKS: Above files separated into individual tracks
- ATTACK: Attack behaviour of _P. sordidus_
- ANALYSIS: Conversion of tracks into excel spreadsheets with some initial graphs and analysis

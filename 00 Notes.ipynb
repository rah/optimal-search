      "## Concepts\n",
      "One approach to the question what is \"Area Restricted Search\" is to define the types of search problems that animals encounter. These concepts may then be used to evaluate possible search tactics appropriate to the problem, and then find examples of search which may or may not indicate the validity of such tactics. Once a possible search tactic for a problem has been identified then questions may be asked as to how the appropriate information (or what information) may be obtained to solve for that particular search problem, and the conflicts that may arise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The search problems considered assume that:\n",
      "- The resource is essentially a point resource\n",
      "- The search path width is small in comparison to the area which can be covered in a foraging bout\n",
      "- The direction of the resource is equiprobable\n",
      "\n",
      "## Search Problems\n",
      "\n",
      "### Within Habitat\n",
      "Search within a habitat with no information about the location of the resource other than possibly some information as to the quality of the habitat. The size of the habitat is large in comparison to the resource and resources may occur in patches within the habitat. In this case search may have high directionality and possibly a reflecting boundary (assuming the boundary is discernable). The best form of search with no errors in detection and navigation would be a systematic search ie parallel strip. Assumes the resource is uniformly or randomly distributed in the habitat. Given infomation on habitat quality, errors in detection the speed of search may also differ. An example of this type of search may be that of  adult female _P. rapae_. A giving up time is also necessary in these situations. Other examples are Pyke's optimal harvester and Cody's finch flocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### Within Patch (defined boundaries)\n",
      "Search within a patch having clearly defined boundaries. Possibly some infomation on the quality of the patch, but no infomation on the location of items within the patch. This problem logically follows on from habitat search. The difference may be one of scale and possibly means of identification or detection of the patch. The scale might be that many patches may be discovered within a foraging period within a habitat, whereas fewer habitats may be visited in a foraging period. The best search tactic may again be systematic with reflecting boundaries. Directionality may be lower and the search path show a higher meander due to the smaller search area. The distribution of effort will then be evenly distributed across the patch. Bumble-bees may show systematic search within a flower head? Also requires a giving up time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### Within Patch (undefined boundaries)\n",
      "Search within a patch having undefined boundaries. Information on the quality of patch and size of patch? No infomation on  the location of items in the patch other than a lower probability as the search path moves away from the point of detection or initiation of search. This follows on from the last type but is the first of the type of search problem which has an initial start position. Classical concept of a.r.s.?  Again follows on from the last, but the distribution of effort  will not be uniform over the area it should be more concentrated in areas which have a higher target probability. The form of systematic search might be a spiral, but again with errors in detection and navigation time may be wasted. Possibly the search path should be centered on the start position with effort being initially distributed uniformly in the area of highest equal  probability and then looping out beyond this region whilst returning to the center. As time increases the total region to be searched increases so that the loops become larger until a giving up point is reached.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Stationary Target\n",
      "Search for a stationary target which has been lost. Infomation available is the last known position of the target which may well be the start position of search. This search problem is probably the most well documented both in biological papers (isopods and ants) and operations research where precise analytical solutions are well known. Same search path as c) but initially with no region of equiprobable target position. As search time increases the target distribution will alter to that of c). Two situations are possible in this type of search. For the isopod and ant examples there is no giving up time - the resource is not renewable. For other animals further resources may be available thus a giving up time is necessary depending on the availability of these resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Displaced Target\n",
      "Search for an escaped item. Target distrbution is centered on the point of initial contact but shifted away from the origin. From observation of _Polinices_ sp. an initial search is carried out in the immediate vicinity of the contact and then moves out to the area of highest target probability. With time the initial target distribution may change more rapidly than the previous problems as the target may move out of the area after the initial escape response.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary\n",
      "The above senarios may form a continuum, although a) and b) may be more similar than c), d) and e). This series may also form a conceptual model for the evolution of search behaviour as there is a systematic increase in the degree of difficulty of the problem in terms of infomation and integration required for the solution of the problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "One danger is to accept that the above do indeed form a continuum whereas there may be discontinuity in the optimal search tactics, and the use of an infinitely variable continuum may give sub-optimal solutions. On the other hand contraints on the system may prove this to be \"optimal\". Possibly a,b form one set and c,d,e form another set. Or a), b) may be viewed as local area search; d) ,e) as point search (ie initiated from a point or origin) and c) as intergrading between these.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another problem is one of scale a), b) are not really different except at the level of scale, and c),d) and e) are just variations on a theme: is there any real difference?\n",
      "\n",
      "For any search problem there exists:\n",
      "- a target function\n",
      "- a detection function\n",
      "- a cost function\n",
      "\n",
      "Definition of these should allow the analytical solution to many search problems and define the optimal allocation of effort. From this the search path can be derived which appears to be a subjective process. Little appears to be published, as often it has been a military problem and remains classified. Certain problems still remain to be solved in the area of operations research e.g. search for a conscious evader, or where the movement of the target is not random and is unknown to the searcher.\n",
      "\n",
      "When should area restricted search be carried out and what is the objective of the search? It is clear that numerous reasons for belief, sources of error, situations of conflict can arise. To consider these problems in the absence of specific animals in particular foraging situations may not be productive. It is necessary to place the problem in context of the animal. Therefore it might be productive to list examples of foraging and evaluate them in reference to the perceived problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the original question; is a.r.s to utilize a patch or find something lost in the classic examples published in the literature so far. The answer depends on the scale of the problem. If the items in the patch are so close together so that they are within or close to the perceptual distance of the searcher then patch a.r.s. seems incorrect. The reason for a.r.s. may then be re-finding the patch after accidently losing it. eg aphid or egg patches with coccinellids and parisitoids.\n",
      "\n",
      "With reference to _P. rapae_ caterpillars the reason that the \"clock\" may not be reset after a contact is:\n",
      "- The probability of losing a real patch is very low or said differently losing your plant is a real but low probability.\n",
      "- I found one but I lost it is an unlikely event, therefore it was more likely to be a false alarm\n",
      "- I'm still very hungry and therefore it is unlikely that there are any in this immediate area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore the \"clock\" may not be immediately reset but is a longer term event. Also the question as to whether the item found is of good quality may not be immediately answerable.\n",

      "## Introduction\n",
      "Area restricted search (ARS) is a specific form of search activity conducted to find additional resources given that  one or more resources have already been discovered. The resources discovered may be utilised, or may only be detected. This form of search is generally characterised by an increased turning rate and slower speed at the onset of search, then returning to prior levels after a certain time period. Undirected search is defined as the movement pattern displayed prior to discovery and commencement of ARS. The characteristics of undirected search will depend on the searchers internal state and current environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that undirected search may also exhibit a high level of sinuosity. For example in a habitat or patch of high quality, it may be worthwhile to exhibit a high level of sinuosity to stay in the area. This may apply in particular to those habitats that have no clear boundaries. The problem here is to differentiate  between the search behaviour immediately after a contact to the search within a high quality patch (if indeed there is a difference). \n",
      "\n",
      "There are potentially a wide range of area restricted search behaviours, the form of search considered here is restricted to where: \n",
      "- The resource is essentially a point resource.\n",
      "- The search path width is small in comparison to the area which can be covered in a foraging bout.\n",
      "- The direction of the resource is equiprobable\n",
      "\n",
      "The major components that influence the resultant search path during ARS are:\n",
      "- giving up time\n",
      "- angles turned\n",
      "- speed\n",
      "- probability of +ve turn\n",
      "- detection function\n",
      "- probability distribution of target\n",
      "\n",
      "## Giving Up Time\n",
      "Giving up time (GUT) from the perspective of ARS is the time taken for the components of angle turned, speed, and probability of +ve (or -ve) turns to return to the values that existed prior to the detection of the target and commencement of ARS. GUT is dependant on a number of factors associated with the searcher and it's current environment. These factors may include:\n",
      "- hunger\n",
      "- time since the last detection\n",
      "- number of detections\n",
      "- rate of detections\n",
      "- time since general seaching began (conversely, time left for searching)\n",
      "- knowledge of prior searches, i.e a more global knowledge of the environment\n",
      "\n",
      "All of these factors give some indication of the environment quality. A measure of this quality is necessary in order to vary those parameters of angle turned, speed, and probability of +ve turn, such that the search path may be \"optimised\". \n",
      "\n",
      "Values of GUT range from a few seconds (insects) to periods of greater than 60 minutes (pers obs on Polynices sp.)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Angle Turned\n",
      "The angles turned during the execution of ARS typically show an increased turning rate in the initial stages of the search and then return to the levels of angle turned exhibited during undirected search. The time that it takes for undirected search levels to be returned to may be taken to be the giving up time. \n",
      "\n",
      "Three functional responses may define the characteristics for changes in angle turned:\n",
      "- linear\n",
      "- sigmoid\n",
      "- negative exponential\n",
      "\n",
      "Each response will show a decrease in the magnitude of the angles turned as time passes until a point is reached at which the angles turned level off to a value which reflects a specific state of undirected search within a given habitat or patch.\n",
      "\n",
      "A linear response would give an even distribution of search up to giving up time, a  sigmoid response would give a more concentrated search pattern in comparison, and an exponential response a more spread out search pattern.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the functional response of the angles turned, the varience of the angle turned needs to be considered. The varience of the angles turned throughout ARS may change in a manner similar to that described for the functional response i.e. show a high varience at the start of ARS and reducing with time (or other responses). \n",
      "\n",
      "The varience may also be dependant on the varience of the angles turned for undirected search. In an area of high quality the distribution of angles turned may exhibit a greater varience which may serve to keep the searcher in such an area for a longer period. Observations of Polynices sp. indicate that undirected search in richer patches shows a more meandering path than those in poorer patches.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Speed\n",
      "The speed of movement often shows a reduction in the initial stages of ARS with a return to normal levels at the resumption of undirected search.  The form this may take may be linear or non-linear. In a similar manner to angles turned, the varience associated with the speed at time t may vary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three functional responses may define the characteristics for changes in angle turned:\n",
      "- linear\n",
      "- sigmoid\n",
      "- monotonically increasing\n",
      "\n",
      "A sigmoid response would tend to show a more concentrated search than linear which in turn would be more concentrated than a monotonically increasing response assuming the same giving up time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Observations of Polynices sp show an initial increased speed for a short period, then following the pattern of reduced speed with a return to normal levels over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Probability of Turn\n",
      "The probability of a left or right turn may vary during the course of area restricted search, ranging from very high to equiprobable left or right turns.  Searches with a high probability of a turn in one direction will show looping patterns, whereas searches with equiprobable turns will appear to be more random in the initial stages when the amount of turn is high, then becoming more directional as the turning rate becomes low.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Detection Function\n",
      "The detection function is the relationship between the probability of detection and the range of the target from the searcher. In situations where the detection range is small, the \"throughness\" of the search will need to be greater to detect the target. The combination of the detection function and the abundance of potential resources will vary the optimal giving up time and optimal search path.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Probability Distribution of Target\n",
      "This is the probability of finding a resource at distance x from the initiation of search. The shape of this distribution can vary in both the x and y directions. In most situations, without additional information the probability distribution is circular. In those situations where the target is likely to have moved in one direction then the distribution will be skewed in that direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Study Goals\n",
      "The purpose of the study is to investigate the relationship between the parameters involved in ARS, especially the relationship between GUT, resource distribution, and resource quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Identify the characteristics of:\n",
      "- turning rate \n",
      "- speed\n",
      "- turn direction \n",
      "\n",

      "- examples in literature\n",
      "- work conducted with Polinices sp.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Study Approach\n",
      "Due to the complex nature of the problem domain an analytical approach will not be used. Simulation modelling will form the major tool to determine the nature of area restricted search across a range of simple senarios with appropriate sensitivity analysis to determine those factors which have the greatest effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional techniques will be investigated to determine their applicability to the general area. These techniques may include the application of genetic algorithms and genetic programming in conjunction with neural networks to investigate potential areas of optimality and emergent behaviours, i.e. search behaviours that may develop in a \"naive\" population. \n",
      "esponse would give a more concentrated search pattern in comparison, and an exponential response a more spread out search pat??? the amount of turn is high, then becoming more directional as the turning rate becomes low.\n",

      "During search for prey items a number of events may potentially occur as a predator approaches a prey item. \n",
      "The predator may detect the prey through chemoreception even though the prey item has not moved. The predator may detect the prey item through mechanoreception,where the prey is either conducting feeding movements (or otherundisturbed behaviour), or the prey item has detected the approach of a predator and is initiating an escape response. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the possible detection of a prey item, the predator will may conduct an initial attack on the prey item, which may be followed by seach behaviour if the attack is not successful. The degree to which thisbehaviour may occur will be dependant on the hunger of the predator and the strength of the initial stimulus. These two factors will be interdependent. \n",
      "\n",
      "A hungry predator is more likely to attack a low stimulus, whereas a less hungry predator may be more discerning. A low stimulus is more likely to be a false target or a small prey item which will return a low reward for the effort that would be expended in capturing and drilling the prey item.\n",
      "\n",
